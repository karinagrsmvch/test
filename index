<p>When I moved back to my hometown after ten years away, I was surprised by how much things had changed. I still <input type="text" id="word1" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> my childhood best friend, even though we’ve barely spoken in years. I guess that’s what happens—you just slowly <input type="text" id="word2" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here">, especially when life takes you in different directions.</p>
<p>Last week, I <input type="text" id="word3" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> that Tom, our old neighbor, had been <input type="text" id="word4" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> after a car accident. It was shocking because everyone used to <input type="text" id="word5" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> him—he was kind, generous, and always helping others.</p>
<p>My brother and I <input type="text" id="word6" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> a few months ago, unfortunately, and haven’t really talked since. It wasn’t a big fight, but tensions had been building, and he always tries to <input type="text" id="word7" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> when fixing things, which drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our garden got completely flooded because the <input type="text" id="word8" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> broke and wouldn’t shut off. I told my dad about it, and he said, “Well, you really <input type="text" id="word9" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here">—this whole system needs replacing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our cousin Jake has changed a lot. He used to be calm, but now he often <input type="text" id="word10" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> when he doesn’t get what he wants. He also tends to do things that are a bit <input type="text" id="word11" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here">, like showing up with expensive gifts for no reason.</p>
<p>Despite everything, I always try to <input type="text" id="word12" class="word-gap" placeholder="Insert word here"> when I can. Life doesn’t wait around, and you need to make the most of your chances.</p>
